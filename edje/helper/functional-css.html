<h1>Functional CSS</h1>

<article>
Want to use our styles as HTML class? You can simply put this snippet in `framework.scss`:

```scss
@each $name, $values in $_h-all {
  .#{ $name } {
    @include h( $name );
  }
}
```

Now you can use it as class:

```html
<div class="b1-solid p15 bg-main c-white">
  ...
</div>
```

This is a concept that some people enjoyed using, but it's not my cup of tea.
