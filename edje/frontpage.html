## What is Edje?

Edje is a **Functional Sass framework**. Basically we provide many shorthand styles, so instead of writing `padding: 1em`, we just write `p1`.

Let's take a look at how we write CSS normally:

```css
.page-thumbnail {
  background-color: red;
  border: 2px solid black;
  padding: 1em;
  color: white;
}
```

Using **Edje framework**, we will write it like this:

```scss
// Sass syntax
.page-thumbnail
  +h( bg-red  b2-solid  b-black  p1  c-white )

// or with SCSS syntax
.page-thumbnail {
  @include h( bg-red  b2  b-black50  p1  c-white );
}
```

## Why use Edje?

Some benefits based on our experiences are:

- **Compact Codebase** - Easier to skim through the code.

- **Fun**. Yeah I know this is subjective. But if you enjoy writing CSS with Emmet, you are going to like this framework.

- **Instant Styleguide** - All customizable variables are stored in **_settings.scss**, that automatically become a styleguide to your team.


## How to Use Edje?

1. Copy (1) `sass/_settings.scss`, (2) `sass/edje/` directory, and (3) `sass/edje.sass`. Organize them to fit your project structure.
1. Add `@import "edje"` at the top of the Sass files where you want to use Edje.
1. Compile them. Done!

First time working with Sass? Here's a [short guide](#how-to-compile-sass) on how to compile them.

Also this whole repository can actually be used as a simple boilerplate. Just delete `/demo` directory.

**Note**: If you want to use other framework like Bootstrap, no need to copy `sass/edje.sass` because that contains our Normalizer and Grid System.

# Other Features

## 1. Grid System

We use the new CSS3 Grid. It is divided into 12 columns and you can define the portion using the class `large-x` and `small-x`.

Small column size is applied when the screen is below 767px (customizable in variable `$size-s`).

[Read more about our Grid System](https://hrsetyono.github.io/edje/#/helper/grid)

```html
<h-grid>
  <div class="large-8 small-6">
    ...
  </div>
  <div class="large-4 small-6">
    ...
  </div>
</h-grid>
```

Result:

## 2. Media Query

We don't like using mixin for media query, instead we use variable within `@media` block like this:

```scss
.button
  +h( p1 )

  @media ($below-s)
    +h( p05 )

  @media ($above-m) and ($portrait)
    +h( p15 )
```

Those variables are defined in **_settings.scss**. Let me explain what those mean.

First thing first, there are 4 default breakpoints in Edje:

- XS (extra xmall) is 480px
- S (small) is 767px
- M (medium) is 960px
- and L (large) is 1120px.

So the variable `$below-s` means when the screen is below 767px or translated to `max-width: 767px`.

Same thing goes to `$above-m` which translated to `min-width: 961px`. For "$above", we add 1px to the breakpoint so it won't clash with "$below".

## What is the Difference with Functional CSS?

You might recognize Edje's concept from Functional CSS framework such as [Tachyon](https://tachyons.io/). They write the shorthand syntax as HTML class like this:

```html
<div class="bg-red b2 b-black50 p1 c-white">
  ...
</div>
```

It felt weird when I first saw that, but [this article](https://www.mikecr.it/ramblings/functional-css/) convinced me to give it a try. The idea is not having to write CSS and no need to think about class name.

But in practice, I still need to write CSS for Hover effect, Pseudoselector, Media query, and other advanced CSS like animation. **I ended up going back and forth between my HTML and CSS** which gets messy.

Edje framework solves that.

If you need Hover effect, Pseudoselector, or Media Query:

```scss
.button
  +h( bg-red p1 c-white )

  &:hover
    +h( bg-blue )

  @media ($below-s)
    +h( p05 ) // padding: 0.5rem
```

If you need advanced CSS, simply write it old-fashioned way:

```scss
.button
  +h( bg-red p1 c-white )

  animation: 1s fadeInUp both
  transform: rotate(5deg)
```

## How to Compile Sass

1. Install [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

1. Open CMD (or Terminal if you're using Mac) and run the command `npm install -g node-sass`.

1. Open CMD inside your project directory and run the command `npm run sass`. That command is a shortcut we defined in **package.json**.
