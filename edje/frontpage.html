<h1>Edje Framework</h1>

<article>

Edje is a **Functional CSS framework**. Instead of writing semantic class name, we use many single-purpose classes like `.ta-center` to center text and `.p-1` to add 1em padding.

To make it clearer, here's how most of us write CSS:

```
<div class="page-thumbnail"> </div>

.page-thumbnail {
    background-color: red;
    border: 2px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
    padding: 1em;
}
```

Using **Edje framework**, we wrote it like this:

```
<div class="bg-red b-2 b--black50 p-1"> </div>


.bg-red { background-color: red; }
.b-2 { border: 2px solid; }
.b--black50 { border-color: rgba(0,0,0, .5); }
.p-1 { padding: 1em; }
```

Those mini classes are already provided by the framework. As you can see, we wrote less CSS by writing more in the HTML. It sounds like a bad practice, but it has been proven to have more benefits such as:

- **Better understanding in team**. By just reading the class, they can roughly know how it is styled.

- **Safer to update**. When we modify an existing CSS, we often afraid to break things on other pages, not the case with Functional CSS.

- **Faster development** - You might say using full-fledged framework like Bootstrap is faster. But from my experience, I spent longer time trying to override or customize their default styling.

- **Fun**. Yeah I know that this is subjective. For me and other Functional CSS users, combining a bunch of small things to create larger entity is enjoyable, .

**But it's not DRY!**

If you are writing plain HTML, then sure it is not DRY. But with many templating engine available, you can easily create reusable element.

This is a whole new way on doing front-end development and it's hard to swallow without trying it firsthand. So go ahead and give it a quick try on [this Codepen](https://codepen.io/hrsetyono/pen/XyJary/).
