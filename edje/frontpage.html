<h1>Edje Framework</h1>

<article>

Edje is a **Functional Sass framework**. Basically we provide many shorthand styles, so instead of writing `padding: 1em`, we just write `p1`.

To make it clearer, here's an example of a class definition:

```sass
.page-thumbnail {
  background-color: red;
  border: 2px solid rgba(black, 0.5);
  padding: 1em;
}
```

Using **Edje framework**, we wrote it like this:

```sass
.page-thumbnail {
  @include h( bg-red  b2  b-black50  p1 );
}
```

Those mini styles are defined by Edje and easily customizable by overriding a Sass variable.

Some of you might think it's a bad practice to add an abstraction layer to CSS. But we've seen benefits such as:

- **Compact Codebase** - Easier to skim through the code.

- **Faster development** - You might say using full-fledged framework like Bootstrap is faster. But from my experience, I spent longer time trying to override or customize their default styling.

- **Fun**. Yeah I know that this is subjective. But for me, combining a bunch of small things to create larger entity is enjoyable.

## Installation

1. Install [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

1. Run these 2 commands as administrator:

    ```
    npm install -g node-sass
    npm install -g edje
    ```

1. If you are on Windows, add **NODE_PATH** to your System Variable and set it to **%AppData%/npm/node_modules**.

1. Test whether it's successfully installed by running the command `npm`. If not found, try restarting your PC and double-check your `NODE_PATH`. If still doesn't work, run these [4 commands](http://stackoverflow.com/a/9588052/1318622) one by one.

## Boilerplate

We have HTML, Wordpress, and WooCommerce template / boilerplate. To use it, install it with these commands:

```
npm install -g yeoman
npm install -g generator-edje
```

To generate the template, open command line **in your project directory** and type:

```
yo edje
```

Select the template with arrow key and press Enter.

Alternatively, you can get the template files directly from these repository:

- [HTML](https://github.com/hrsetyono/edje-html-boilerplate)
- [WordPress](https://github.com/hrsetyono/edje-wp-boilerplate)


-----

## Compiling Sass

Open command line in the theme directory and type `npm run sass`. Now whenever you save the Sass files, it will automatically compile into CSS.

Something to take note of:

- If you create new `.scss` file, you need to restart the command to make it detected.
- If the variable in `_settings.scss` calls another variable, you need to uncomment the called variable or else it will return "Variable not found" error.
- If you use unknown Class name, it will put a warning in the command log.
