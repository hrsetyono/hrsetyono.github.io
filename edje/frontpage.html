<h1>Edje Framework</h1>

<article>

Edje is a **Functional CSS framework**. Instead of writing semantic class name, we use many single-purpose classes like `.ta-center` to center text and `.p-1` to add 1em padding.

NOTICE: We're working on the design for this documentation. Currently it's still rough, but it gets the jobs done :)

For example, here's how most of us write CSS:


    <div class="page-thumbnail"> </div>

    .page-thumbnail {
      background-color: red;
      border: 2px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
      padding: 1em;
    }

Using Edje framework, we wrote it like this:

    <div class="bg-red b-2 b--black50 p-1"> </div>


    .bg-red { background-color: red; }
    .b-2 { border: 2px solid; }
    .b--black50 { border-color: rgba(0,0,0, .5); }
    .p-1 { padding: 1em; }

Those mini classes are already provided by the framework. As you can see, we wrote less CSS by writing more in the HTML. It sounds like a bad practice, but it has been proven to have more benefits such as:

- Easier for your team to be in the same page. By just reading the class, they can roughly know how it is styled.

- Safer to change an element's styling on the fly. You don't need to be afraid of breaking `.page-thumbnail` in other pages.

This is a whole new way on doing front-end development and it's hard to swallow without trying it firsthand. So go ahead and try it on [this Codepen](https://codepen.io/hrsetyono/pen/XyJary/).

## Installation

1. Install [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

1. There are 4 global packages required. Run these commands below one by one.

    ```
    npm install -g node-sass
    npm install -g edje
    ```

1. If you are on Windows, add **NODE_PATH** to your System Variable and set it to **%AppData%/npm/node_modules**.

1. Test whether it's successfully installed by running the command `npm`. If not found, try restarting your PC and double-check your `NODE_PATH`. If still doesn't work, run these [4 commands](http://stackoverflow.com/a/9588052/1318622) one by one.
