# Installation

1. Install [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

1. Run the command `npm install -g node-sass` and `npm install -g edje`.

1. If you are on Windows, add **NODE_PATH** to your System Variable and set it to **%AppData%/npm/node_modules**.

1. Test whether it's successfully installed by running the command `npm`. If not found, try restarting your PC and double-check your `NODE_PATH`. If still doesn't work, run these [4 commands](http://stackoverflow.com/a/9588052/1318622) one by one.
