# Customization

Across the documentation we mentioned whether it is customizable via variable or not. When it does, simply open `_settings.scss`, uncomment it, and add extra item to the list.

Since the list might refer to a variable (like `$color-blue`), you need to uncomment that variable too.

For example, here's the list for Color classes (`c-x`).

    $color-classes: (
      body: $font-color,
      passive: $font-color-passive,

      ...
    );

If you want to add new color for navigation, simply add:

    $color-classes: (
      body: $font-color,
      passive: $font-color-passive,

      nav: #235050

      ...
    );

Save it, compile the Sass, and now you can use the class `c-nav`.

## Responsive

Some components like Padding and Margin have responsive capability by default. 

All customizable components can have responsive capability by simply adding the media query size like `s` for small screen. [Read more on Edje Media Query](#/home/media-query).

    $padding-classes: (
      ...
      1: 1rem,
      15: 1.5rem,
      2: 2rem,
      3: 3rem,
      4: 4rem,

      s: (),
    ) ;
