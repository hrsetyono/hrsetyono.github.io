<h1>Customization</h1>

<article>

Across the documentation we mentioned whether it is customizable via variable or not. When it does, simply open `_settings.scss`, uncomment it, and add extra item to the list.

**Note**: Since the list might refer to a variable, you need to uncomment that variable too.

**EXAMPLE:**

We want to add a new font family. As written in the documentation, we need to find and override `$h-font-family` in `_setting.scss`:

``` sass
$h-font-family: (
  names: ( ff-: font-family ),
  values: (
    body: $font-family,
    header: $font-family-header
  )
);
```

The variable are divided into two main parts: (1) `names` - The base shorthand and CSS properties (2) `values` - Postfix for the shorthand and the CSS value.  Edje will pair each name to each value. In this case, it will create two styles: `ff-body` and `ff-header`.

Let's add in a new font:

```sass
$h-font-family: (
  names: ( ff-: font-family ),
  values: (
    body: $font-family,
    header: $font-family-header,
    script: "Papyrus"
  )
);
```

Save it, compile the Sass, and now you can use `ff-script` to apply Papyrus font.

```sass
.page-title {
  @include h( ff-script );
}
```

## Direct Format

Few of the variables doesn't use Name-Value pair, instead it directly specify the Class name and its CSS style like below:

```sass
$h-border-radius: (
  br: ( border-radius: $g-radius ),
  br-circle: ( border-radius: 50% ),
  br-pill: ( border-radius: 999px ),
);
```

Calling `br-circle` will give me `border-radius: 50%;` style.

## Pseudoselector Format

Specify the styling for any pseudoselector with this format:

```sass
name: (
  ":hover": ( ... ),
  ":active": ( ... ),
  "::before": ( ... ),
),
```

You can see it in action in `$h-hover` variable:

```sass
$h-hover: (
  hover-dim: (
    ':hover': ( opacity: .6 ),
    ':active': ( opacity: .8 ),
  ),
  hover-grow: (
    ':hover': ( '-webkit-transform': scale(1.05), transform: scale(1.05) ),
    ':active': ( '-webkit-transform': scale(1), transform: scale(1) ),
  ),
  hover-u: ( ':hover': ( text-decoration: underline ) ),
);
```
